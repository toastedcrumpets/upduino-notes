This is a tutorial example taken from a blog post from
[Idorobots](https://blog.idorobots.org/entries/upduino-fpga-tutorial.html).

The actual code is in [blinky.v](blinky.v), while the Pin Constraint File (.pcf)
file contains the mapping from the pin names in the verilog to the actual
hardware pins. This pinout is for the upduino 2, 3, and 3.1.
